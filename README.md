# GCD-Project
Repository for Getting and Cleaning Data course Project

# The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, 
# work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that 
# can be used for later analysis.

# UCI Human Activity Recognition (HAR) data set
## The UCI HAR data set represent data collected from the accelerometers from 
## the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the 
## following site:
## http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

## Data for the project was obtained from:
## https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

# The R script "run_analysis.R" does the following:
## 1. Downloads, extracts and reads the UCI HAR data set
## 2. Extracts mean and standard deviation measurements for each variable
## 3. Merges the training and the test data sets to create one data set
## 4. Uses descriptive activity names to the activities in the data set
## 5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
## 6. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each
##    variable for each activity and each subject

## The comments included within the run_analysis.R script provides description
## of what each step(s)
